# Key-Finding-Algorithm

This is a key finding algorithm I created based on an elimination method. You can run audio files and it will rate the possible keys of the file. 
If you are using your own audio, you may need to edit the path in the first function. It is set to extract audio files from a folder called uploaded_audio.
